Emaily is a Fullstack Email Subscription Application written in Node and React. It uses MongoDB as a backend.

Currently, Emaily is in development phase.

## Quick update.
Emaily uses Google OAuth for authentication purposes. I have finished the complete oauth flow. I will also provide a demo test url of the application here. Demo application will be deployed to Heroku.
